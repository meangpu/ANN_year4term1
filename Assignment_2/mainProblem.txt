Assignment 2: Two-layer MLP on hand-written digits


Main goal is to study effects of #HUs and training variables, i.e., lr and #epochs on final performance.

Use sigmoid as activation function for HUs.

Train it with regular gradient descend method.
(We want to lay a solid foundation.)


Each treatment repeats at least 10 times to see the variation due to random initialization.
